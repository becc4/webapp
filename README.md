# WebApp
## Overview

My initially plan was to make a specific grocery list app that allowed you to add and remove items, possibly adding amounts of items as well. However, at the beginning of the two weeks for this project, I got sick and I stayed sick even to today. The brain-fog symptom made it difficult to learn and apply so I was only able to get through the Django Poll app module where I learned about how to make a WebApp.

This app is the Django Poll app from the introduction module. You can create and delete questions as well as vote for them.

## Development Environment

I used VSCode and wrote the program in Python3, supported by CSS and HTML. The Django version I used was 4.2.
